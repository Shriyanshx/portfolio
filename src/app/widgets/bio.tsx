            <strong>Passionate and Versatile Software Developer</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            With over 5 years of hands-on experience in the dynamic world of
            software development, I bring a wealth of expertise in creating robust
            and innovative solutions. My journey began in the fast-paced startup
            environment, where I honed my skills in Flutter, becoming adept at
            crafting cross-platform mobile applications with a focus on seamless
            user experiences.
          </p>

          <p>
            During my tenure at Reliance Jio, I delved into the realm of
            automation testing using Cucumber, contributing to the enhancement of
            software quality and reliability. This experience provided me with a
            unique perspective on the importance of testing in the software
            development lifecycle.
          </p>
          <p>
            My technical repertoire includes proficiency in Flutter, GetX,
            Firebase, and native iOS/Android development. I thrive on challenges
            and have a proven track record of delivering high-quality code within
            demanding timelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond the lines of code, my passion for technology fuels a continuous
            drive for learning and staying abreast of the latest industry trends.
            I am committed to pushing boundaries and creating software that not
            only meets but exceeds expectations.
